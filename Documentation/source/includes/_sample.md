# Sample Application

You can find the sample application in the Example directory.

<aside class="warning">
If you try to run the application now, you won't be able to logon. You must
first install the required pods then add your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET
</aside>

In the terminal navigate to the `Example` folder and run the following command:

**`pod install`**

This will install the required pods and create a CircuitSDK.xcworkspace,
open that file instaead of the CircuitSDK.xcodeproj.

In the `Sample/Resources` folder open `AppDelegate.swift`, here you can add your
[**`CLIENT_ID`**](#authorization) and [**`CLIENT_SECRET`**](#authorization)

Now that you have set your OAuth credentials, and installed the required
CocoaPods you are ready to run the application.

Press the run button.
